# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The main goal in this project is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles present in videos (test_video.mp4 and project_video.mp4).

The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train Linear SVM classifier
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run processing pipeline on a video stream to detect vehicles in video frames 
* Estimate a bounding box around detected vehicles.
