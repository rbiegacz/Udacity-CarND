    This function implements the main flow of the application
    Project Steps will be as follows:
    - Camera calibration
    - Distortion correction
      Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
    - Color/gradient threshold
      Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
    - Perspective transform
      Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
    - After doing these steps, youâ€™ll be given two additional steps for the project:
    - Detect lane lines
      Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
    - Determine the lane curvature
      Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
    - Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
      Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical
      estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
